# ReactAuthenticationBookmarks
The Bookmark Manager is an application that allows users to bookmark specific URLs, and save them in a list for future reference. Using Authorization and Authentication, only users that are logged in have access to add and view bookmarks..

There is a Home page as well that displays the top 5 most bookmarked URLs by all users, with a count of how many times that URL was bookmarked.

This application utilizes C# in the backend, and React in the frontend.
